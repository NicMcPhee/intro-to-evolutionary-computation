;; A knapsack problem specification is a map with two entries: `:max-weight`
;; and `:items`. The `:items` entry will be a sequence of maps, each map
;; containing a `:weight` and a `:value` key.

(def sample-knapsack-problem
  "A simple instance of a knapsack problem.
   This has 10 items for potential inclusion. The first on is own is the global
   optima, filling the sack and having value 7. The next best local optima is
   is the last 6 items, which together fill the sack and have a total value of
   6. Replacing any two of those items with one of the weight 2 items will
   slightly reduce the value, leading to another local optima."
